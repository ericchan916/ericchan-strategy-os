# EricChan Strategy OS

Stage 0.5 is a local daily strategy report generator for EricChan. It reads external AI trend signals, combines them with `context/context.md`, asks an OpenAI-compatible LLM for project-aware analysis, and writes both Markdown and structured JSON.

It is not a generic AI news digest. A useful report must connect trends to EricChan projects such as iPortfolio, XiaoChan AI Persona, OPC exploration, EricChan Strategy OS, and the agent/tool chain.

## Stage 0.5 Goal

Prove this loop:

```text
external AI trends + EricChan project context
-> LLM analysis
-> daily strategy report
-> Markdown + JSON
-> future Obsidian archive and Dashboard
```

This stage does not include a full Dashboard, login, database, or multi-user system.

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

Node.js 18 or newer is required.

## Configure `.env`

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your OpenAI-compatible API settings:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

```bash
LLM_API_KEY=your_key_here
LLM_API_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

Use the base URL without `/chat/completions`; the script appends that path.
Do not commit `.env`.

## Run Mock Mode

Mock mode does not call a real LLM API and is the safest first run:

```bash
npm run report:mock
```

It still writes a complete Markdown and JSON report.

## Run Real API Mode

After `.env` is configured:

```bash
npm run report
```

If a source fails to fetch, the script records a warning and continues. If `LLM_API_KEY` is missing or the API call fails, the script falls back to mock analysis instead of crashing.

To confirm whether the run used the real API, open `data/reports/YYYY-MM-DD.json` and check:

- `"mode": "live"` means the LLM API returned a report.
- `"mode": "mock"` means mock analysis was used.
- `warnings` will say why fallback happened, such as `LLM_API_KEY not set`.

## V0.1.1 Real Report Quality Validation

V0.1.1 adds a lightweight quality gate for the generated JSON report:

```bash
npm run validate:report
```

By default it validates `data/reports/YYYY-MM-DD.json`. You can also validate a specific file:

```bash
node scripts/validate-report.js data/reports/2026-06-30.json
```

The validator checks that the report has trends, project impacts, opportunities, next actions, agent dispatch suggestions, Obsidian export data, project bindings, and the three required self-check flags:

- `qualityChecklist.boundToProjects`
- `qualityChecklist.hasExecutableAction`
- `qualityChecklist.avoidsGenericSummary`

The report also stores the result in `qualityValidation` and the Markdown self-review section prints a score such as `12/12`.

## Output Files

Each run writes:

- `reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `data/reports/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- `data/raw/YYYY-MM-DD.json`

`reports/` is for Obsidian-friendly Markdown. `data/reports/` is for future Dashboard consumption. `data/raw/` stores collected source items.

## How To Judge Report Value

A report is useful only if it passes these checks:

- It binds trends to concrete EricChan projects.
- It creates at least one executable next action.
- It includes an opportunity inbox.
- It recommends agent dispatch without actually calling those agents.
- It names what should be ignored or watched.
- It avoids generic "AI news is important" language.

## Real Report Acceptance Standard

A real report is accepted for Stage 0.5 only when:

- `mode` is `live`.
- `npm run validate:report` returns a full score.
- At least one trend is connected to a specific EricChan project.
- The opportunity inbox contains at least one `test` or `build` candidate.
- The next action can be executed without needing a Dashboard.
- The dispatch section recommends agents but does not call them.

If `mode` is `mock`, treat it as a pipeline check, not a real strategy report.

## Source Handling

Trend sources live in `config/sources.config.json`. Prefer official RSS, changelog, release, or blog sources. If a source becomes unstable:

- Replace it with a stable official RSS/API when available.
- Use an official webpage source if no RSS exists.
- Disable it or convert it to `manual-placeholder` if it creates noise.
- Do not add a crawler just to rescue one source.

## Commands

```bash
npm run report       # live sources + real API when .env is configured
npm run report:mock  # mock trends + mock analysis
npm run validate:report # validate the generated report quality
npm run clean        # remove generated report files, keep .gitkeep files
npm test             # run local verification tests
```

## Stage 1 / Stage 2 Ideas

Enter Stage 1 only after several real reports are useful without manual rescue: they should bind trends to projects, produce executable actions, and pass `npm run validate:report`.

Stage 1 can add a small local Dashboard that reads `data/reports/*.json`, filters opportunities by status, and shows project impact history.

Stage 2 can add richer source ingestion, Obsidian export automation, recurring schedules, trend deduplication, and explicit feedback scoring across multiple days.
